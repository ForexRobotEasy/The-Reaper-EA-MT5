## Description

The Reaper EA MT5 is an advanced forex trading software designed specifically for night scalping. It utilizes various filters, safety measures, and performance tracking techniques to optimize trading performance. The key features of this code include:

1. **News Filter feature**: This feature checks if there is a high-impact news event. If such an event is detected, trading is skipped during volatile market conditions.

2. **Individual performance monitor**: The code tracks the performance of each currency pair and takes necessary actions based on profitability. If a currency pair's performance is not well, the risk is reduced. If it becomes profitable again, the risk is reset.

3. **Correlation filter**: The code checks for excessive exposure to a specific currency pair. If the exposure exceeds the defined maximum exposure, trading is skipped to reduce potential risks.

4. **Night scalping algorithm**: The code identifies currency pairs suitable for night scalping and analyzes nightly ranges for each pair. If a reversal is detected within the nightly range, profitable trades are executed.

5. **Sophisticated filters and safety measures**: The code applies multiple filters and safety measures to enhance trading performance and reduce potential risks.
